# Scaloid template project

This is a template project that can be a starting point of a new [Scaloid](https://github.com/pocorall/scaloid) project. Base on [pocorall template](https://github.com/pocorall/hello-scaloid-sbt). Difference:
- Reorganize structure to classic (move *res/*, *AndroidManifest.xml* and *.scala* to *src/main*)
- Modify build.sbt
